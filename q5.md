# Sort an array of 0s, 1s and 2s

- We can keep the count of 0s, 1s and 2s and then pring 0, 1 and 2 that many times







```
    nums = [0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2, 2, 0]
    vector<int> count(3, 0);
    for i, v in nums{
        count[v]++;
    }

    for i from 0 to 3 {
        for j from 0 to count[i] {
            cout << i << " ";
        }
    }
}
```
